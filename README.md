Refreshing data in a dashboard on a timer is something that many Tableau users would like to do. However, not everyone got the skills or time to use the JavaScript API or wants to hack around with Web Data Connectors. Now there is another solution! With the Keep it Fresh Extension you can refresh your data on a specific time interval. Select your data sources, specify a time value and a countdown clock will appear on your dashboard. Want to style the countdown clock? We got you sorted. You can set it to whatever colour matches your dashboard!

This extension is of course free to download and use.
